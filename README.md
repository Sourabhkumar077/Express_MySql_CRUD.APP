# Express-MySQL CRUD API

This is a practice project where I built a RESTful API using **Express.js** and **MySQL** to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Add a new user  
- 📄 View all user data  
- 🔢 View total number of users  
- ✏️ Update a user's username  
- 🗑️ Delete a user  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL
- Postman (for API testing)

## 📚 API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint         | Description            |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| POST   | `/addUser`      | Add a new user         |
| GET    | `/users`         | View all user data     |
| GET    | `/`              | View total user count  |
| PUT    | `//user/:id/edit`   | Update username        |
| DELETE | `/user/:id/delete`   | Delete a user          |
